# CS300 - Data Structures  


This repository contains my **complete homework submissions** for **CS300 - Data Structures** at **SabancÄ± University**.  
The course focused on the design, implementation, and analysis of fundamental and advanced data structures and algorithms in **C++**, with particular emphasis on efficiency, modular design, and problem-solving strategies.  

ðŸ‘‰ All assignments were developed, tested, and debugged using **Xcode** on macOS, showcasing my proficiency in using a modern IDE and toolchain for C++ software development.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

Throughout this course and the work presented in this repository, I aimed to:

âœ… Implement key **data structures from scratch** (linked lists, trees, heaps, graphs, hash tables, disjoint sets).  
âœ… Apply and analyze **sorting algorithms** with respect to time and space complexity.  
âœ… Write efficient, clean, and modular **C++ code** suitable for reuse and extension.  
âœ… Utilize **Xcodeâ€™s toolchain and debugging capabilities** for development on macOS.  
âœ… Understand and apply **algorithmic complexity analysis** (Big-O notation).  
âœ… Solve problems involving **graph traversal**, **priority queues**, and **balanced trees** using custom code.
